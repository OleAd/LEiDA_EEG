LEADING EIGENVECTOR DYNAMICS ANALYSIS (LEiDA) adapted for EEG

LEiDA consists of computing instantaneous phase coherence matrices 
and clustering the corresponding leading eigenvectors into a set of 
patterns that can be visualized on the cortical surface or in matrix format.
  
This repository is forked from the original repository, which included 
the codes and data to replicate the analysis reported in the manuscript:

performance in healthy aging to spontaneous switching between brain states
